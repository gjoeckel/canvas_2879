I'll click on the \"Section 2: Images\" link to view a Section page.\nSections\nMost Section pages have four parts:\n\nObjectives\nLearning Activities\nResource Links\nQuiz\n\nObjectives\nThe section's objectives are listed in the order that they are covered in the Learning Activities. Section objectives identify core concepts that will be measured in quizzes and exams.\nNext, I'll click on the \"Images: Part 1\" link to view a Learning Activity page.\nLearning Activities\nMost Learning Activity pages have three parts:\n\nVideo\nExample File(s)\nGuide\n\nVideo\nVideos are viewed through an embedded player.

I'll click the \"Return\" button in the upper-left corner of this results page, and then click the Home link. Module 1 is now unlocked, so I'll click its link on the Home page to view it.\n\nModules\nModule pages have three parts:\n\nObjective\nSections\nExam\n\nObjective\nThe Module 1 Objective is: \"Review basic principles and processes for optimizing the accessibility of document content in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint.\" Each Module has several topic-based Sections. I'll click on the \"Section 2: Images\" link to view a Section page.\nSections\nMost Section pages have four parts:\n\nObjectives\nLearning Activities\nResource Links\nQuiz\n\nObjectives\nThe section's objectives are listed in the order that they are covered in the Learning Activities. Section objectives identify core concepts that will be measured in quizzes and exams.\nNext, I'll click on the \"Images: Part 1\" link to view a Learning Activity page.\nLearning Activities\nMost Learning Activity pages have three parts:\n\nVideo\nExample File(s)\nGuide\n\nVideo\nVideos are viewed through an embedded player. Start the video by navigating to the \"Play clip\" button through the keyboard and pressing \"Enter\", or by clicking with the mouse. The player has controls for volume, video speed, quality settings, and entering full screen mode. As the video plays, its quality setting will be adjusted automatically according to your connection speed. All videos have \"open captions\"\u2014text information that is displayed in a black band at the bottom of the video. \nExample Files\nNext on the page, a link to any example file, or files, is provided. Clicking on a file's link will open the document in an embedded viewer. You can click the \"Download\" link on the document viewer to save a copy to your computer.

Step-by-step instructions are provided for any process demonstrated in a video. At the top and the bottom of a Learning Activity page there are buttons to return to the section page. I'll click one of these buttons to return to the Section 2 page.\nResource Links\nSome sections have Resource Links. These are links to external resources related to the Section's content. For example, Section 2 has links to information from Microsoft.\nQuiz\nYou must complete ALL of a section's learning activities before you take the section's quiz. In this case, after completing the \"Images: Part 2\" and \"Images: Part 3\" learning activities, I would click the \"Next\" button at the bottom of the page to take the quiz for Section 2.\nAll Section Quizzes:\n\nAre open notes\u2014you may use any resources that you have developed\nHave between four (4) and eight (8) multiple-choice questions that assess your mastery of the section's objectives\nAre timed\u2014six (6) minutes per question\nRequire a score of 100% to earn a certificate\nUnlimited attempts\n\nTo start this Quiz, I'll click on the \"Take the Quiz\" button.

      "text": "Modules\nModule pages have three parts:\n\nObjective\nSections\nExam\n\nObjective\nThe Module 1 Objective is: \"Review basic principles and processes for optimizing the accessibility of document content in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint.\" Each Module has several topic-based Sections. I'll click on the \"Section 2: Images\" link to view a Section page.\nSections\nMost Section pages have four parts:\n\nObjectives\nLearning Activities\nResource Links\nQuiz\n\nObjectives\nThe section's objectives are listed in the order that they are covered in the Learning Activities. Section objectives identify core concepts that will be measured in quizzes and exams.\nNext, I'll click on the \"Images: Part 1\" link to view a Learning Activity page.\nLearning Activities\nMost Learning Activity pages have three parts:\n\nVideo\nExample File(s)\nGuide\n\nVideo\nVideos are viewed through an embedded player. Start the video by navigating to the \"Play clip\" button through the keyboard and pressing \"Enter\", or by clicking with the mouse. The player has controls for volume, video speed, quality settings, and entering full screen mode. As the video plays, its quality setting will be adjusted automatically according to your connection speed. All videos have \"open captions\"\u2014text information that is displayed in a black band at the bottom of the video. \nExample Files\nNext on the page, a link to any example file, or files, is provided. Clicking on a file's link will open the document in an embedded viewer. You can click the \"Download\" link on the document viewer to save a copy to your computer. On the Learning Activity page, another option is to click the image with the down arrow after the file's link to download the document.\nGuide\nThe Guide functions as a transcript for the video, and features graphic elements, as well as links to any course content that is referenced. Step-by-step instructions are provided for any process demonstrated in a video. At the top and the bottom of a Learning Activity page there are buttons to return to the section page. I'll click one of these buttons to return to the Section 2 page.\nResource Links\nSome sections have Resource Links. These are links to external resources related to the Section's content. For example, Section 2 has links to information from Microsoft.\nQuiz\nYou must complete ALL of a section's learning activities before you take the section's quiz. In this case, after completing the \"Images: Part 2\" and \"Images: Part 3\" learning activities, I would click the \"Next\" button at the bottom of the page to take the quiz for Section 2.\nAll Section Quizzes:\n\nAre open notes\u2014you may use any resources that you have developed\nHave between four (4) and eight (8) multiple-choice questions that assess your mastery of the section's objectives\nAre timed\u2014six (6) minutes per question\nRequire a score of 100% to earn a certificate\nUnlimited attempts\n\nTo start this Quiz, I'll click on the \"Take the Quiz\" button. For this demonstration, I'm going to select the first answer for each question. After I have answered all of the questions, I'll click the \"Submit Quiz\" at the bottom of the page. Canvas shows me which questions I answered incorrectly:\n\nBecause I want to answer all the questions correctly before moving on to the next section, I will need to retake this quiz.\nOnce you have completed all of the Section Quizzes, you will take the Module Exam. I will use the inline \"Next\" buttons to skip past Sections 3, 4, & 5\u2014and their quizzes\u2014to reach Exam 1.\nExam\nAll Module Exams:\n\nAre open notes\nHave ten (10) multiple-choice questions that have been selected at random from each of the module's section quizzes\nAre timed\u2014six (6) minutes per question, for a total time of sixty (60) minutes\nRequire a score of 80% or better to earn a certificate\nOne retake",
